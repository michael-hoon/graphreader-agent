Introduction\\nReal-time object detection is a very important topic in\\ncomputer vision, as it is often a necessary component in\\ncomputer vision systems. For example, multi-object track-\\ning [94, 93], autonomous driving [40, 18], robotics [35, 58],\\nmedical image analysis [34, 46], etc. The computing de-\\nvices that execute real-time object detection is usually some\\nmobile CPU or GPU, as well as various neural processing\\nunits (NPU) developed by major manufacturers. For exam-\\nple, the Apple neural engine (Apple), the neural compute\\nstick (Intel), Jetson AI edge devices (Nvidia), the edge TPU\\n(Google), the neural processing engine (Qualcomm), the AI\\nprocessing unit (MediaTek), and the AI SoCs (Kneron), are\\nall NPUs. Some of the above mentioned edge devices focus\\non speeding up different operations such as vanilla convolu-\\ntion, depth-wise convolution, or MLP operations. In this pa-\\nper, the real-time object detector we proposed mainly hopes\\nthat it can support both mobile GPU and GPU devices from\\nthe edge to the cloud.\\nIn recent years, the real-time object detector is still de-\\nveloped for different edge device. For example, the devel-\\nFigure 1: Comparison with other real-time object detectors, our\\nproposed methods achieve state-of-the-arts performance.\\nopment of MCUNet [49, 48] and NanoDet [54] focused on\\nproducing low-power single-chip and improving the infer-\\nence speed on edge CPU. As for methods such as YOLOX\\n[21] and YOLOR [81], they focus on improving the infer-\\nence speed of various GPUs. More recently, the develop-\\nment of real-time object detector has focused on the de-\\nsign of efﬁcient architecture. As for real-time object de-\\ntectors that can be used on CPU [54, 88, 84, 83], their de-\\nsign is mostly based on MobileNet [28, 66, 27], ShufﬂeNet\\n[92, 55], or GhostNet [25]. Another mainstream real-time\\nobject detectors are developed for GPU [81, 21, 97], they\\nmostly use ResNet [26], DarkNet [63], or DLA [87], and\\nthen use the CSPNet [80] strategy to optimize the architec-\\nture. The development direction of the proposed methods in\\nthis paper are different from that of the current mainstream\\nreal-time object detectors. In addition to architecture op-\\ntimization, our proposed methods will focus on the opti-\\nmization of the training process. Our focus will be on some\\noptimized modules and optimization methods which may\\nstrengthen the training cost for improving the accuracy of\\nobject detection, but without increasing the inference cost.\\nWe call the proposed modules and optimization methods\\ntrainable bag-of-freebies.\\n1\\narXiv:2207.02696v1  [cs.CV]  6 Jul 2022'), Document(metadata={'source': 'docs/YOLOv7 Trainable bag-of-freebies sets new state-of-the-art for real-time object detectors.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='Recently, model re-parameterization [13, 12, 29] and dy-\\nnamic label assignment [20, 17, 42] have become important\\ntopics in network training and object detection. Mainly af-\\nter the above new concepts are proposed, the training of\\nobject detector evolves many new issues. In this paper, we\\nwill present some of the new issues we have discovered and\\ndevise effective methods to address them. For model re-\\nparameterization, we analyze the model re-parameterization\\nstrategies applicable to layers in different networks with the\\nconcept of gradient propagation path, and propose planned\\nre-parameterized model. In addition, when we discover that\\nwith dynamic label assignment technology, the training of\\nmodel with multiple output layers will generate new issues.\\nThat is: “How to assign dynamic targets for the outputs of\\ndifferent branches?” For this problem, we propose a new\\nlabel assignment method called coarse-to-ﬁne lead guided\\nlabel assignment.\\nThe contributions of this paper are summarized as fol-\\nlows: (1) we design several trainable bag-of-freebies meth-\\nods, so that real-time object detection can greatly improve\\nthe detection accuracy without increasing the inference\\ncost; (2) for the evolution of object detection methods, we\\nfound two new issues, namely how re-parameterized mod-\\nule replaces original module, and how dynamic label as-\\nsignment strategy deals with assignment to different output\\nlayers. In addition, we also propose methods to address the\\ndifﬁculties arising from these issues; (3) we propose “ex-\\ntend” and “compound scaling” methods for the real-time\\nobject detector that can effectively utilize parameters and\\ncomputation; and (4) the method we proposed can effec-\\ntively reduce about 40% parameters and 50% computation\\nof state-of-the-art real-time object detector, and has faster\\ninference speed and higher detection accuracy.\\n2. Related work\\n2.1. Real-time object detectors\\nCurrently state-of-the-art real-time object detectors are\\nmainly based on YOLO [61, 62, 63] and FCOS [76, 77],\\nwhich are [3, 79, 81, 21, 54, 85, 23]. Being able to become\\na state-of-the-art real-time object detector usually requires\\nthe following characteristics: (1) a faster and stronger net-\\nwork architecture; (2) a more effective feature integration\\nmethod [22, 97, 37, 74, 59, 30, 9, 45]; (3) a more accurate\\ndetection method [76, 77, 69]; (4) a more robust loss func-\\ntion [96, 64, 6, 56, 95, 57]; (5) a more efﬁcient label assign-\\nment method [99, 20, 17, 82, 42]; and (6) a more efﬁcient\\ntraining method. In this paper, we do not intend to explore\\nself-supervised learning or knowledge distillation methods\\nthat require additional data or large model. Instead, we will\\ndesign new trainable bag-of-freebies method for the issues\\nderived from the state-of-the-art methods associated with\\n(4), (5), and (6) mentioned above.\\n2.2. Model re-parameterization\\nModel re-parametrization techniques [71, 31, 75, 19, 33,\\n11, 4, 24, 13, 12, 10, 29, 14, 78] merge multiple compu-\\ntational modules into one at inference stage. The model\\nre-parameterization technique can be regarded as an en-\\nsemble technique, and we can divide it into two cate-\\ngories, i.e., module-level ensemble and model-level ensem-\\nble. There are two common practices for model-level re-\\nparameterization to obtain the ﬁnal inference model. One\\nis to train multiple identical models with different train-\\ning data, and then average the weights of multiple trained\\nmodels. The other is to perform a weighted average of the\\nweights of models at different iteration number. Module-\\nlevel re-parameterization is a more popular research issue\\nrecently. This type of method splits a module into multi-\\nple identical or different module branches during training\\nand integrates multiple branched modules into a completely\\nequivalent module during inference. However, not all pro-\\nposed re-parameterized module can be perfectly applied to\\ndifferent architectures. With this in mind, we have devel-\\noped new re-parameterization module and designed related\\napplication strategies for various architectures.\\n2.3. Model scaling\\nModel scaling [72, 60, 74, 73, 15, 16, 2, 51] is a way\\nto scale up or down an already designed model and make\\nit ﬁt in different computing devices. The model scaling\\nmethod usually uses different scaling factors, such as reso-\\nlution (size of input image), depth (number of layer), width\\n(number of channel), and stage (number of feature pyra-\\nmid), so as to achieve a good trade-off for the amount of\\nnetwork parameters, computation, inference speed, and ac-\\ncuracy. Network architecture search (NAS) is one of the\\ncommonly used model scaling methods. NAS can automat-\\nically search for suitable scaling factors from search space\\nwithout deﬁning too complicated rules. The disadvantage\\nof NAS is that it requires very expensive computation to\\ncomplete the search for model scaling factors. In [15], the\\nresearcher analyzes the relationship between scaling factors\\nand the amount of parameters and operations, trying to di-\\nrectly estimate some rules, and thereby obtain the scaling\\nfactors required by model scaling. Checking the literature,\\nwe found that almost all model scaling methods analyze in-\\ndividual scaling factor independently, and even the methods\\nin the compound scaling category also optimized scaling\\nfactor independently. The reason for this is because most\\npopular NAS architectures deal with scaling factors that are\\nnot very correlated. We observed that all concatenation-\\nbased models, such as DenseNet [32] or V oVNet [39], will\\nchange the input width of some layers when the depth of\\nsuch models is scaled. Since the proposed architecture is\\nconcatenation-based, we have to design a new compound\\nscaling method for this model.\\n2'), Document(metadata={'source': 'docs/YOLOv7 Trainable bag-of-freebies sets new state-of-the-art for real-time object detectors.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='Figure 2: Extended efﬁcient layer aggregation networks. The proposed extended ELAN (E-ELAN) does not change the gradient transmis-\\nsion path of the original architecture at all, but use group convolution to increase the cardinality of the added features, and combine the\\nfeatures of different groups in a shufﬂe and merge cardinality manner. This way of operation can enhance the features learned by different\\nfeature maps and improve the use of parameters and calculations.\\n3. Architecture\\n3.1. Extended efﬁcient layer aggregation networks\\nIn most of the literature on designing the efﬁcient ar-\\nchitectures, the main considerations are no more than the\\nnumber of parameters, the amount of computation, and the\\ncomputational density. Starting from the characteristics of\\nmemory access cost, Ma et al. [55] also analyzed the in-\\nﬂuence of the input/output channel ratio, the number of\\nbranches of the architecture, and the element-wise opera-\\ntion on the network inference speed. Doll´ar et al. [15] addi-\\ntionally considered activation when performing model scal-\\ning, that is, to put more consideration on the number of el-\\nements in the output tensors of convolutional layers. The\\ndesign of CSPV oVNet [79] in Figure 2 (b) is a variation of\\nV oVNet [39]. In addition to considering the aforementioned\\nbasic designing concerns, the architecture of CSPV oVNet\\n[79] also analyzes the gradient path, in order to enable the\\nweights of different layers to learn more diverse features.\\nThe gradient analysis approach described above makes in-\\nferences faster and more accurate. ELAN [1] in Figure 2 (c)\\nconsiders the following design strategy – “How to design an\\nefﬁcient network?.” They came out with a conclusion: By\\ncontrolling the shortest longest gradient path, a deeper net-\\nwork can learn and converge effectively. In this paper, we\\npropose Extended-ELAN (E-ELAN) based on ELAN and\\nits main architecture is shown in Figure 2 (d).\\nRegardless of the gradient path length and the stacking\\nnumber of computational blocks in large-scale ELAN, it has\\nreached a stable state. If more computational blocks are\\nstacked unlimitedly, this stable state may be destroyed, and\\nthe parameter utilization rate will decrease. The proposed\\nE-ELAN uses expand, shufﬂe, merge cardinality to achieve\\nthe ability to continuously enhance the learning ability of\\nthe network without destroying the original gradient path.\\nIn terms of architecture, E-ELAN only changes the archi-\\ntecture in computational block, while the architecture of\\ntransition layer is completely unchanged. Our strategy is\\nto use group convolution to expand the channel and car-\\ndinality of computational blocks. We will apply the same\\ngroup parameter and channel multiplier to all the compu-\\ntational blocks of a computational layer. Then, the feature\\nmap calculated by each computational block will be shuf-\\nﬂed into g groups according to the set group parameter g,\\nand then concatenate them together. At this time, the num-\\nber of channels in each group of feature map will be the\\nsame as the number of channels in the original architec-\\nture. Finally, we add g groups of feature maps to perform\\nmerge cardinality. In addition to maintaining the original\\nELAN design architecture, E-ELAN can also guide differ-\\nent groups of computational blocks to learn more diverse\\nfeatures.\\n3.2. Model scaling for concatenation-based models\\nThe main purpose of model scaling is to adjust some at-\\ntributes of the model and generate models of different scales\\nto meet the needs of different inference speeds. For ex-\\nample the scaling model of EfﬁcientNet [72] considers the\\nwidth, depth, and resolution. As for the scaled-YOLOv4\\n[79], its scaling model is to adjust the number of stages. In\\n[15], Doll´ar et al. analyzed the inﬂuence of vanilla convolu-\\ntion and group convolution on the amount of parameter and\\ncomputation when performing width and depth scaling, and\\nused this to design the corresponding model scaling method.\\n3'), Document(metadata={'source': 'docs/YOLOv7 Trainable bag-of-freebies sets new state-of-the-art for real-time object detectors.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='Figure 3: Model scaling for concatenation-based models. From (a) to (b), we observe that when depth scaling is performed on\\nconcatenation-based models, the output width of a computational block also increases. This phenomenon will cause the input width\\nof the subsequent transmission layer to increase. Therefore, we propose (c), that is, when performing model scaling on concatenation-\\nbased models, only the depth in a computational block needs to be scaled, and the remaining of transmission layer is performed with\\ncorresponding width scaling.\\nThe above methods are mainly used in architectures such as\\nPlainNet or ResNet. When these architectures are in execut-\\ning scaling up or scaling down, the in-degree and out-degree\\nof each layer will not change, so we can independently an-\\nalyze the impact of each scaling factor on the amount of\\nparameters and computation. However, if these methods\\nare applied to the concatenation-based architecture, we will\\nﬁnd that when scaling up or scaling down is performed on\\ndepth, the in-degree of a translation layer which is immedi-\\nately after a concatenation-based computational block will\\ndecrease or increase, as shown in Figure 3 (a) and (b).\\nIt can be inferred from the above phenomenon that\\nwe cannot analyze different scaling factors separately for\\na concatenation-based model but must be considered to-\\ngether. Take scaling-up depth as an example, such an ac-\\ntion will cause a ratio change between the input channel and\\noutput channel of a transition layer, which may lead to a de-\\ncrease in the hardware usage of the model. Therefore, we\\nmust propose the corresponding compound model scaling\\nmethod for a concatenation-based model. When we scale\\nthe depth factor of a computational block, we must also cal-\\nculate the change of the output channel of that block. Then,\\nwe will perform width factor scaling with the same amount\\nof change on the transition layers, and the result is shown\\nin Figure 3 (c). Our proposed compound scaling method\\ncan maintain the properties that the model had at the initial\\ndesign and maintains the optimal structure.\\n4. Trainable bag-of-freebies\\n4.1. Planned re-parameterized convolution\\nAlthough RepConv [13] has achieved excellent perfor-\\nmance on the VGG [68], when we directly apply it to\\nResNet [26] and DenseNet [32] and other architectures,\\nits accuracy will be signiﬁcantly reduced. We use gradi-\\nent ﬂow propagation paths to analyze how re-parameterized\\nconvolution should be combined with different network.\\nWe also designed planned re-parameterized convolution ac-\\ncordingly.\\nFigure 4: Planned re-parameterized model. In the proposed\\nplanned re-parameterized model, we found that a layer with resid-\\nual or concatenation connections, its RepConv should not have\\nidentity connection. Under these circumstances, it can be replaced\\nby RepConvN that contains no identity connections.\\nRepConv actually combines 3 × 3 convolution, 1 × 1\\nconvolution, and identity connection in one convolutional\\nlayer. After analyzing the combination and correspond-\\ning performance of RepConv and different architectures,\\nwe ﬁnd that the identity connection in RepConv destroys\\nthe residual in ResNet and the concatenation in DenseNet,\\nwhich provides more diversity of gradients for different fea-\\nture maps. For the above reasons, we use RepConv with-\\nout identity connection (RepConvN) to design the architec-\\nture of planned re-parameterized convolution. In our think-\\ning, when a convolutional layer with residual or concate-\\nnation is replaced by re-parameterized convolution, there\\nshould be no identity connection. Figure 4 shows an exam-\\nple of our designed “planned re-parameterized convolution”\\nused in PlainNet and ResNet. As for the complete planned\\nre-parameterized convolution experiment in residual-based\\nmodel and concatenation-based model, it will be presented\\nin the ablation study session.\\n4'), Document(metadata={'source': 'docs/YOLOv7 Trainable bag-of-freebies sets new state-of-the-art for real-time object detectors.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='Figure 5: Coarse for auxiliary and ﬁne for lead head label assigner. Compare with normal model (a), the schema in (b) has auxiliary head.\\nDifferent from the usual independent label assigner (c), we propose (d) lead head guided label assigner and (e) coarse-to-ﬁne lead head\\nguided label assigner. The proposed label assigner is optimized by lead head prediction and the ground truth to get the labels of training\\nlead head and auxiliary head at the same time. The detailed coarse-to-ﬁne implementation method and constraint design details will be\\nelaborated in Apendix.\\n4.2. Coarse for auxiliary and ﬁne for lead loss\\nDeep supervision [38] is a technique that is often used\\nin training deep networks. Its main concept is to add\\nextra auxiliary head in the middle layers of the network,\\nand the shallow network weights with assistant loss as the\\nguide. Even for architectures such as ResNet [26] and\\nDenseNet [32] which usually converge well, deep supervi-\\nsion [70, 98, 67, 47, 82, 65, 86, 50] can still signiﬁcantly\\nimprove the performance of the model on many tasks. Fig-\\nure 5 (a) and (b) show, respectively, the object detector ar-\\nchitecture “without” and “with” deep supervision. In this\\npaper, we call the head responsible for the ﬁnal output as\\nthe lead head, and the head used to assist training is called\\nauxiliary head.\\nNext we want to discuss the issue of label assignment. In\\nthe past, in the training of deep network, label assignment\\nusually refers directly to the ground truth and generate hard\\nlabel according to the given rules. However, in recent years,\\nif we take object detection as an example, researchers often\\nuse the quality and distribution of prediction output by the\\nnetwork, and then consider together with the ground truth to\\nuse some calculation and optimization methods to generate\\na reliable soft label [61, 8, 36, 99, 91, 44, 43, 90, 20, 17, 42].\\nFor example, YOLO [61] use IoU of prediction of bounding\\nbox regression and ground truth as the soft label of object-\\nness. In this paper, we call the mechanism that considers\\nthe network prediction results together with the ground truth\\nand then assigns soft labels as “label assigner.”\\nDeep supervision needs to be trained on the target ob-\\njectives regardless of the circumstances of auxiliary head or\\nlead head. During the development of soft label assigner re-\\nlated techniques, we accidentally discovered a new deriva-\\ntive issue, i.e., “How to assign soft label to auxiliary head\\nand lead head ?” To the best of our knowledge, the relevant\\nliterature has not explored this issue so far. The results of\\nthe most popular method at present is as shown in Figure 5\\n(c), which is to separate auxiliary head and lead head, and\\nthen use their own prediction results and the ground truth\\nto execute label assignment. The method proposed in this\\npaper is a new label assignment method that guides both\\nauxiliary head and lead head by the lead head prediction.\\nIn other words, we use lead head prediction as guidance to\\ngenerate coarse-to-ﬁne hierarchical labels, which are used\\nfor auxiliary head and lead head learning, respectively. The\\ntwo proposed deep supervision label assignment strategies\\nare shown in Figure 5 (d) and (e), respectively.\\nLead head guided label assigner is mainly calculated\\nbased on the prediction result of the lead head and the\\nground truth, and generate soft label through the optimiza-\\ntion process. This set of soft labels will be used as the tar-\\nget training model for both auxiliary head and lead head.\\nThe reason to do this is because lead head has a relatively\\nstrong learning capability, so the soft label generated from it\\nshould be more representative of the distribution and corre-\\nlation between the source data and the target. Furthermore,\\nwe can view such learning as a kind of generalized residual\\nlearning. By letting the shallower auxiliary head directly\\nlearn the information that lead head has learned, lead head\\nwill be more able to focus on learning residual information\\nthat has not yet been learned.\\nCoarse-to-ﬁne lead head guided label assigner also\\nused the predicted result of the lead head and the ground\\ntruth to generate soft label. However, in the process we gen-\\nerate two different sets of soft label, i.e., coarse label and\\nﬁne label, where ﬁne label is the same as the soft label gen-\\nerated by lead head guided label assigner, and coarse label\\nis generated by allowing more grids to be treated as posi-\\ntive target by relaxing the constraints of the positive sample\\nassignment process. The reason for this is that the learning\\nability of an auxiliary head is not as strong as that of a lead\\nhead, and in order to avoid losing the information that needs\\nto be learned, we will focus on optimizing the recall of aux-\\niliary head in the object detection task. As for the output\\nof lead head, we can ﬁlter the high precision results from\\nthe high recall results as the ﬁnal output. However, we must\\nnote that if the additional weight of coarse label is close to\\n5'), Document(metadata={'source': 'docs/YOLOv7 Trainable bag-of-freebies sets new state-of-the-art for real-time object detectors.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='Table 1: Comparison of baseline object detectors.\\nModel #Param.

At the same time, we\\nalso use basic model for model scaling for different ser-\\nvice requirements and get different types of models. For\\nYOLOv7, we do stack scaling on neck, and use the pro-\\nposed compound scaling method to perform scaling-up of\\nthe depth and width of the entire model, and use this to ob-\\ntain YOLOv7-X. As for YOLOv7-W6, we use the newly\\nproposed compound scaling method to obtain YOLOv7-E6\\nand YOLOv7-D6. In addition, we use the proposed E-\\nELAN for YOLOv7-E6, and thereby complete YOLOv7-\\nE6E. Since YOLOv7-tiny is an edge GPU-oriented archi-\\ntecture, it will use leaky ReLU as activation function. As\\nfor other models we use SiLU as activation function. We\\nwill describe the scaling factor of each model in detail in\\nAppendix.\\n6'), Document(metadata={'source': 'docs/YOLOv7 Trainable bag-of-freebies sets new state-of-the-art for real-time object detectors.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content='Table 2: Comparison of state-of-the-art real-time object detectors.\\nModel #Param.

This type of training can make up for informa-\\ntion that may be lost in the next level pyramid prediction.\\nFor the above reasons, we designed partial auxiliary head\\nin the proposed E-ELAN architecture. Our approach is to\\nconnect auxiliary head after one of the sets of feature map\\nbefore merging cardinality, and this connection can make\\nthe weight of the newly generated set of feature map not\\ndirectly updated by assistant loss. Our design allows each\\npyramid of lead head to still get information from objects\\nwith different sizes.

Conclusions\\nIn this paper we propose a new architecture of real-\\ntime object detector and the corresponding model scaling\\nmethod. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that the evolving process\\nof object detection methods generates new research top-\\nics. During the research process, we found the replace-\\nment problem of re-parameterized module and the alloca-\\ntion problem of dynamic label assignment. To solve the\\nproblem, we propose the trainable bag-of-freebies method\\nto enhance the accuracy of object detection.

However, research works that discuss the critical challenges with deep learning models from the \\nreactor safety perspective are limited. This article presents the state-of-the-art in deep learning application in \\nnuclear reactor safety analysis, and the inherent limitations in deep learning models. In addition, critical issues \\nsuch as deep learning model explainability, sensitivity and uncertainty constraints, model reliability, and \\ntrustworthiness are discussed from the nuclear safety perspective, and robust solutions to the identified issues are \\nalso presented. As a major contribution, a deep feedforward neural network is developed as a surrogate model to \\npredict turbulent eddy viscosity in Reynolds-averaged Navier – Stokes (RANS) simulation. Further, the deep \\nfeedforward neural network performance is compared with the conventional Spalart Allmaras closure model in \\nthe RANS turbulence closure simulation. In addition, the Shapely Additive Explanation (SHAP) and the local \\ninterpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) APIs are introduced to explain the deep feedforward neural \\nnetwork predictions. Finally, exciting research opportunities to optimize deep learning-based reactor safety \\nanalysis are presented.   \\n1. Introduction \\nIncreasingly, energy policy decisions are shifting in favor of low- \\ncarbon sources. Amid global economic contraction from the effect of \\nCOVID-19, and the debate on global warming, nations are tilting energy \\npolicies toward net-zero emission technology that maximizes return on \\ninvestment. Nuclear power reactors have proven to be a reliable, \\nconsistent, and low-carbon energy source with high energy density. \\nMoreover, the long-operating time, low maintenance cost, and load- \\nfollowing capability present nuclear energy as a potential substitute \\nfor fossil-based sources. However, the construction cost, construction \\ndelays, safety concerns, and public acceptance remain major bottlenecks \\nthat restrict the utilization of nuclear energy. These bottlenecks also \\npose an existential threat to the operating and planned nuclear power \\nplants. \\nTo address some of these bottlenecks and improve the safety and \\neconomic competitiveness of nuclear power plants (NPP), next- \\ngeneration reactors are being developed. These reactors are character -\\nized by modularity, improved safety margin, and significantly less \\nconstruction and operation costs, with support for localized microgrids \\nand multiple energy applications. However, timely development of the \\nnext-generation reactors to meet global net-zero targets require signifi -\\ncant investment and the adoption of advanced research tools and tech -\\nniques. This is evident given the expensive experimental test facilities \\n* Corresponding author. \\n** Corresponding author.

In addition, researchers increasingly \\nrely on computational tools that require a significantly long time to \\nconverge. \\nRecently, machine learning (ML) algorithms are being leveraged to \\nanalyze different engineering systems. In heavy industries, ML models \\nhave been used for reactor probabilistic safety modeling (Worrell et al., \\n2019), risk assessment techniques modernization (Moradi and Groth, \\n2020), and systems identification and control (Patan and Patan, 2020; \\nNaimi et al., 2022). In engineering systems, ML models have also been \\nused for early accident diagnosis (Tolo et al., 2019), to study the reli -\\nability of systems (Xu and Saleh, 2021), and for risk-based inspection \\n(Rachman and Ratnayake, 2019). From optimizing fuel depletion to \\nintelligent load forecasting, ML and data-driven algorithms are also \\nbeing used as advanced predictive tools to enhance the development and \\noptimization of next-generation energy systems (Duan and Luo, 2021). \\nHowever, the conventional ML algorithms are sub-optimal, as signifi -\\ncant data preprocessing and feature engineering are required. Moreover, \\nlatent and spatial generalization is not guaranteed. \\nDeep learning (DL), a subset of ML techniques that utilizes multiple \\nlayers of computational neurons (neural network) to learn the latent \\nrepresentation in a given input, is the state-of-the-art technology used to \\nmodel complex, nonlinear industrial systems (Zhou et al., 2021). A DL \\nmodel has the capability to approximate arbitrary functions, maximize \\naccuracy, and handle high-dimensional and strongly nonlinear prob -\\nlems. In the nuclear industry, the DL model capability is being leveraged \\nto accelerate research in thermal-hydraulic analysis, safety margin \\nquantification, uncertainty analysis, neutron transport prediction, and \\nautonomous control of next-generation reactors. DL techniques have \\nalso been applied in tasks such as the optimization of steam supply \\nsystems (Dong et al., 2020) and the prediction of leakage in reactor \\ncoolant pumps (Nguyen et al., 2021). \\nFurther, DL models have been used as embedded surrogate models to \\ncompress complex and expensive computations. For instance, physics- \\nconstrained DL models are used for surrogate modeling of fluid flows \\n(Sun et al., 2020), for parameter prediction of two-phase flows (Gao \\net al., 2020), for uncertainty quantification (Tripathy and Bilionis, \\n2018), and for modeling nuclear data uncertainties (Radaideh et al., \\n2021a). Deep learning models have also been used to identify flow re -\\ngimes (Yang et al., 2017), predict heat transfer coefficients (Ma et al., \\n2017), calculate critical heat flux (Park et al., 2020), predict void frac -\\ntion (Chu et al., 2021), and characterize two-phase flow (Gao et al., \\n2021), with satisfactory accuracy. Impressive results have also been \\nreported for DL models utilized to forecast the loss of coolant accident \\n(Radaideh et al., 2020; She et al., 2021), to predict reactor water level \\nduring a severe accident (Do Koo et al., 2019), for reactor parameters \\nmonitoring and data augmentation (Ayodeji and Liu, 2019; Ayodeji \\net al., 2019), component fault diagnosis (Kim et al., 2020; Zhao et al., \\n2021a), nuclear plant valve prognosis (Wang et al., 2020, 2021a) and \\nnuclear component predictive maintenance (Liu et al., 2021; Wang \\net al., 2021b). \\nThe current and potential application of DL algorithms in nuclear \\nsafety analysis is attractive. However, critical issues need to be \\naddressed to sustain and improve its application, especially in a highly \\nregulated, nuclear industry. First, the high-risk, safety-critical nuclear \\nenvironment demands proven techniques, as the consequences of a \\nwrong prediction are significant. In addition, implementing black box \\nmodels would constrain DL applications in practical reactor analysis, \\nthis issue should be properly addressed. DL applications in nuclear \\nsafety are becoming prevalent, however, to the best of the authors’ \\nknowledge, research works that discuss the critical challenges with DL \\nmodels from the reactor safety perspective are limited. \\nTowards an enhanced safety margin for the next-generation reactors, \\nthis paper presents the state-of-the-art applications of DL algorithms for \\nnuclear power reactor safety analysis. First, this paper presents the state- \\nof-the-art DL algorithms commonly applied for complex system \\nmodeling. Secondly, the paper critically reviews recent publications in \\nDL algorithm application for nuclear safety analysis and the merits and \\ndemerits of the proposed approaches. Thirdly, the data availability, \\nreliability, and explainability constraints of DL model application for \\nnuclear safety analysis are enumerated. The available literature shows \\nthat the application of DL to two-fluid closure modeling is still nascent. \\nHence, as a major contribution, the application of the DL algorithm as a \\nsurrogate closure model in Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) \\nsimulation is demonstrated. Then, the DL model convergence speed and \\naccuracy is compared with the conventional Spalart Allmaras closure \\nmodel. Further, recent explainability tools that could aid DL models’ \\ntrustworthiness in reactor safety analysis are presented and demon -\\nstrated. This paper contributes to knowledge by addressing the \\nfollowing issues:  \\n1. This work presents the state-of-the-art in deep learning application \\nfor nuclear power reactor safety analysis.  \\n2. From a reactor safety analysis perspective, this study enumerates \\nsources of uncertainty in DL-based models. This paper also discusses \\ndata availability, model reliability, and interpretability issues with \\nthe existing DL approach.  \\n3. To aid the reproducibility of DL-based reactor safety analysis, this \\npaper also demonstrates the application of the deep feedforward \\nneural network (DFNN) model for turbulent eddy viscosity predic -\\ntion using the Eulerian-Eulerian two-fluid model. Moreover, the \\nconvergence speed and accuracy of the DFNN-based turbulence \\nsimulation are compared with the conventional Spalart Allmaras \\nmodel in RANS simulation.  \\n4. Towards improved trust for DL-based reactor safety analysis results, \\ntwo explainability tools – the Shapely Additive Explanation (SHAP) \\nand the local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) – are \\nused to explain the DFNN local and global predictions.  \\n5. Finally, future research focus that could improve reactor safety \\nmargins, optimize reactor performance, and accelerate the devel -\\nopment of next-generation reactors are discussed. \\nThis work is arranged as follows: the next section discusses the state- \\nof-the-art in DL applications for reactor safety assessment. Section 3 \\ndemonstrates the application of a DL model for RANS simulation opti -\\nmization. Section 4 explains the model predictions obtained from sec -\\ntion 3, and section 5 discusses the exciting research opportunities and \\npotential directions towards optimized reactor safety analyses. \\n2. Applications of deep learning in reactor safety assessment: \\nstate-of-the-art \\nThe safety assessment of a nuclear reactor is a systematic process that \\nincludes the safety analysis of the reactor. This safety assessment is \\nperformed to ensure that the reactor design meets the relevant safety \\nrequirements set by the operating organization and the regulators. The \\nsafety analysis involves the use of appropriate numerical tools (system \\nanalysis code, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes, engineering- \\nlevel code, etc.) to establish and confirm the safety of the components \\nof the reactor as well as the overall plant design. The numerical tools are \\nmade up of empirical or semi-mechanistic models that capture the be -\\nhaviors of phenomena that are deemed important to safety in the plant. \\nThese models are traditionally developed from experimental observa -\\ntions. However, the traditional method of developing these empirical \\nmodels is expensive and more so, the models may be limited by the \\nconditions and configurations of the experiments from which they are \\nderived. There is, therefore, the availability of big experimental data for \\ndifferent range of applications. These deficiencies hamper the applica -\\ntion of these models in simulating new systems conditions and config -\\nurations. As a feasible substitute, a statistical data-driven modeling \\napproach, especially modern DL techniques, could be used to reveal the \\nfunctional relations behind the big experimental data and the resulting \\ndata-driven model can be employed instead of the traditional empirical \\nA. Ayodeji et al.

Thus, current application of DL techniques \\nto analyze key reactor components (reactor thermal-hydraulic analysis, \\nreactor core neutronic analysis, fuel loading optimization, severe acci -\\ndent management, etc) are summarized in Table 1 and further presented \\nin detail in the following sections. \\n2.1. Reactor thermal-hydraulics analysis \\nA nuclear reactor involves a large generation of heat, and the heat \\ngeneration must be carefully analyzed to determine the temperature and \\ndensity distribution of various core materials under steady-state and \\ntransient conditions. The temperature limitations of the core materials \\ndetermine the maximum power the reactor core can produce. Thus, \\naccurate prediction of the reactor core temperature through thermal- \\nhydraulic analysis is paramount for the safe operation of the reactor. \\nThe thermal-hydraulic analysis determines the significant parameters \\n(plant efficiency and system coolability) for reactor design and consists \\nof three interdependent key parts: thermodynamic, fluid mechanics, and \\nheat transfer. This analysis can be achieved with the use of \\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) code or system analysis codes as \\ndiscussed in the following sub-sections. \\n2.1.1. Application of deep learning in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) \\nThe application of computational fluid dynamics methods to the \\nstudy of nuclear reactor thermal hydraulics has become prominent over \\nthe years. For transient flows, the application of the basic equations of \\nflow, also known as the Navier-Stokes equations, to the simulation of \\nturbulent flows is called direct numerical simulation (DNS). This tech -\\nnique is ideal for the investigation of the basic turbulence mechanisms, \\nbut its use is limited to weak turbulence flows because the computa -\\ntional costs become prohibitive at a high Reynolds number (representing \\nthe intensity of the turbulence) as reported by Stefan ( Heinz, 2003 ). \\nRegrettably, it is apparent today that DNS in its current form cannot be \\ndeployed for flow predictions of technological or environmental rele -\\nvance. Thus, the DNS method is confined to simple problems of rela -\\ntively low Reynolds number ( ≤ 600 ) as compared to the Reynolds \\nnumber of ~ 1 × 10\\n8 \\ninside the primary piping of a nuclear reactor. To \\nresolve this problem of inapplicability of the basic equations of fluid \\nflows to most industrial problems, the basic equations are averaged \\nthrough ensemble means to obtain mean equations which are called the \\nReynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. A typical example \\nof this RANS formulation is the classical two-fluid model. \\nIn RANS formulation, some transient details are lost due to the \\nensemble averaging process from which they are derived. These lost \\ndetails are compensated for through closure relations which are physics- \\nbased models used to capture the microscopic phenomena ( Ishii and \\nHibiki, 2010 ; Amidu et al., 2020 ), among others. Over the years, \\nempirical or semi-mechanistic correlations derived from experimental \\nobservations and data have been used as closure relations in the RANS \\nmodel. However, the traditional method of developing these empirical \\ncorrelations is expensive and more so, the resultant closure term may be \\nlimited by the conditions and configurations of the experiments from \\nwhich they are derived. There is, therefore, the availability of big \\nexperimental data for a different range of applications. These de -\\nficiencies hamper the application of the computational fluid dynamics \\nmethods in simulating new systems conditions and configurations. As a \\nfeasible substitute, a statistical data-driven modeling approach espe -\\ncially DL technique could be used to reveal the functional relations \\nbehind the big experimental data and the resulting data-driven closure \\nmodel can be employed instead of the traditional empirical or \\nsemi-mechanistic closure relationship. \\nFor the large database to be relevant in data-driven modeling, \\nnumerous preprocessing activities need to be performed on the data \\n( Ackoff, 1989 ). The first step is to collect and categorize the data such \\nthat its archive is readily accessible. Thereafter, the contents of the data \\nshould be evaluated vis- `a-vis their importance to the closure model \\nconditions under consideration. Subsequently, statistical learning \\nmethods (including machine learning) are applied to the refined and \\norganized data to detect and identify functional relations behind the \\ndata. The developed data-driven closure model can then be adopted in \\nthe simulation of thermal fluid problems to enhance the accuracy of the \\nsimulation. The framework of the data-driven modeling approach is \\ndepicted in Fig. 1 which involves Data as a Service (DaaS) concept, and \\nthe Method as a Service (MaaS) concept as can be found in the article \\nwritten by Mell and Grance (2011) . These two concepts (DaaS and \\nMaaS) provide quality assurance and closure relation formulation, \\nrespectively. In addition, a Platform as a Service (PaaS) concept (shown \\nin Fig. 1 ) provides a simulation platform that stores thermal-fluid-model \\nwith distinct DL-base closures that may require a specific numeric \\nscheme. Thus, the PaaS concept provide the platform for model \\nselection. \\nAs far as closure surrogates ’ models are concerned, Chang and Dinh \\n(2019) categorized the ML frameworks into five viz: physics-separated, \\nphysics-integrated, physics-evaluated, physics-recovered, and \\nTable 1 \\nSummary of previous application of deep learning in nuclear safety assessment.  \\nReferences Nuclear safety \\nassessment \\napplication \\nMethod Training Data \\nGeneration \\nPredicted \\nparameter \\nChang and \\nDinh \\n(2019) \\nVertical boiling \\nchannel \\n4-layer \\nFNN \\nTwo-fluid CFD \\nsimulation \\nSlip ratio of a \\nmixture CFD \\nmodel \\nHanna \\net al. \\n(2020) \\nTurbulent flow \\nin a cavity \\n1-layer \\nFNN \\nDNS CFD \\nsimulation \\nCoarse Grid \\n-CFD error \\nBao et al. \\n(2019) \\nTurbulent \\nmixing \\n3-layer \\nFNN \\nRANS CFD \\nsimulation \\nMesh \\noptimization \\nKang et al. \\n(2004) \\nRod bundle 10-layer \\nDNN \\nwith \\nPOD \\nRANS CFD \\nsimulation \\nRod bundle flow \\nfield \\nLing et al. \\n(2016b) \\nTurbulent flow 10-layer DNS simulation Reynold stress \\nanisotropy \\nTian et al. \\n(2018) \\nLoss of coolant \\naccident \\n(LOCA) \\n2- layer \\nFNN \\nRELAP \\nsimulation \\nBreak size in \\nLOCA \\nKim et al. \\n(2019) \\nReactor \\nprotection \\nsystem (alarm) \\nCNN RELAP \\nsimulation \\nReactor states \\nwith alarm \\nSaeed et al. \\n(2020) \\nFault diagnosis LSTM & \\nCNN \\nRELAP \\nsimulation \\nFault types \\nLu et al. \\n(2021a) \\nAnalysis of \\nnuclear reactor \\ncore and steam \\ngenerator \\nDNN RELAP \\nsimulation \\nThermal \\nhydraulic \\nparameters \\nGuillen \\net al. \\n(2020) \\nAnalysis of \\ndrywell cooling \\nfan failure \\nLSTM RELAP \\nsimulation \\nFan coil unit \\noutlet \\ntemperature \\nDo Koo \\net al. \\n(2019) \\nSevere accident \\nmonitoring \\nGA-DNN MAAP \\nsimulation \\nReactor vessel \\nwater level \\nLee et al. \\n(2020) \\nSevere accident \\nmanagement \\nDNN & \\nCNN \\nDPSA/DPRA \\nand MELCOR \\nsimulation \\nOnline operator \\nsupport tool \\nZhao et al. \\n(2021b) \\nMDNBR margin DNN Experimental \\ndataset \\nDeparture from \\nnucleate boiling \\nShriver \\net al. \\n(2021) \\nCore neutronic \\nanalysis \\nCNN VERA \\nsimulation \\nPin power and \\nk\\neff \\nSaleem \\net al. \\n(2020) \\nCore neutronic \\nanalysis \\nDNN PARCS core \\nsimulation \\nPower peaking \\nfactor, control \\nrod level, and \\ncycle length \\nBae et al. \\n(2020) \\nSpent nuclear \\nfuel analysis \\nDNN UNF- \\nST & DARDS \\nUnified \\nDatabase \\nSpent nuclear \\nfuel \\ncomposition \\nand decay heat  \\nA.

The physics-separated framework \\nrequires separation of scales, and the closure relations are separately \\nbuilt from separate effect test (SET) data which is then implemented in \\nthe RANS conservation equations. The separation of the closure model \\nfrom the conservation equations could lead to model biases in case the \\nassumption of separation of scale becomes unachievable. The architec -\\nture of the physics-separated ML framework includes forward \\ndata-driven modeling without feedback. This indicates that the perfor -\\nmance of the closure relation built under physics-separated architecture \\nis largely influenced by the quality of the training data. Whereas the \\nphysics-integrated ML approach does not assume scale separation. \\nRather, data-driven closure relations are incorporated and trained \\nwithin the system dynamics (RANS conservation equations). The data \\nused in this approach could be obtained from separate effect experi -\\nments or integral effect experiments. Therefore, the physics-integrated \\napproach shifts the paradigm from separate effect experimental data \\nto the integral effect experimental data. In this approach, the closure \\nrelations are closely coupled with the conservation equation which \\nmeans that heavy computational cost must be paid when the approach is \\nused even though it promises more accurate prediction of complex \\nthermal fluid problems where separation of scales could result in sig -\\nnificant errors. \\nIn addition, physics-evaluated ML is targeted at minimizing uncer -\\ntainty in the conservation equations, and prior knowledge is required in \\nthe selection of closure models to predict the thermal fluid behavior. \\nWith this technique, high-fidelity data is used to inform a low-fidelity \\nsimulation to minimize the uncertainty in the low-fidelity simulation. \\nThis way, the non-linear thermal fluid physics behind the high- \\ndimensional data can be captured. Moreover, another algorithm is the \\nphysics-recovered ML which is aimed at recovering the exact form of the \\ngoverning equations. This framework constructs a candidate library that \\nincludes components of governing equations such as time derivative, \\nadvection, diffusion, and higher-order terms ( Kutz et al., 2016 ). And \\nlastly, physics-discovered ML is the extreme case that requires neither \\ngoverning equations nor prior knowledge of the closure models. It \\ncompletely relies on data for the discovery of efficient predictive models, \\nand this could be instrumental for a new modeling paradigm for complex \\nthermal fluid systems. \\nDL-based methods can be used to address the numerical errors \\nresulting from discretization during the application of CFD to the \\nsimulation of nuclear thermal-hydraulic phenomena. Towards this end, \\nHanna et al. (2020) conducted a feasibility study on the application of \\nML techniques to produce a proxy model that can compute the \\ncoarse-grid CFD (CG-CFD) local errors to correct a specific variable \\nunder consideration. The principal focus of their work was the correc -\\ntion of discretization error in coarse-grid CFD computation while \\ndisregarding the possible model errors that may happen in the appli -\\ncation of CFD to thermal-hydraulic analysis. This approach was then \\napplied to identify parameters that influence nuclear reactor contain -\\nment thermal-hydraulic (CTH) phenomena ( Hanna et al., 2020 ). By \\nusing the CG-CFD to minimize the computation cost, a surrogate model \\nwas developed to predict the CG-CFD local errors that can be used to \\ncorrect the fluid flow variables. This CG-CFD surrogate model was able \\nto correct coarse grid results and provide reasonable predictions of new \\ncases of 3-dimensional turbulent flow in a lid-driven cavity. \\nLater on, a data-driven framework called Optimal Mesh/Model In -\\nformation System (OMIS) was developed by Bao et al. (2019) to provide \\nerror predictions and suggest the optimal mesh size and models for \\nsystem-level thermal-hydraulic simulation. The development of the \\nOMIS framework is targeted at thermal-hydraulic codes with some \\nspecific features. For instance, it is appropriate for CFD-like codes that \\nuse coarse mesh sizes and simplified boundary-layer correlations whose \\nrange of applicability depends on the respective characteristic lengths \\nscale. It is also deemed appropriate for coarse-mesh Reynolds-averaged \\nNavier – Stokes (RANS) methods with wall functions. The OMIS frame -\\nwork has been successfully applied in both adiabatic fluid and thermal \\nheating fluid dynamics. Moreover, a previous demonstration of the \\nOMIS predictive capability has been showcased for the turbulent mixing \\ncase by Bao et al. (2018) . In addition, the computational cost of CFD \\nsimulation of some time-consuming scenarios (such as sensitivity anal -\\nysis and uncertainty quantification) is a problem that can be addressed \\nusing DL techniques. For instance, Kang et al. (2004) proposed a \\nreduced-order model (ROM) which combines proper orthogonal \\ndecomposition (POD) and DL to solve this kind of computational cost \\nproblem. Using a nuclear reactor fuel rod bundles configuration, the \\nevaluation of the ROM showed an accurate description of the flow fields \\nwith high resolution in only a few milliseconds. \\nAnother key closure parameter that is being targeted with the deep- \\nlearning-based method in the RANS model application to the simulation \\nof nuclear thermal hydraulics is the turbulence model. DL-based \\nmethods have been used to improve turbulence modeling in RANS \\nsimulations using high-fidelity simulations and experimental data ( Kutz, \\n2017 ). The main approach behind the DL-based method is to establish a \\nrelationship between the unclosed terms with other known features \\n(extracted from data) and use the neural network to fit the unknown \\nparameters for this relationship. For instance, Ling and Templeton \\n(2015) applied different DL techniques to evaluate RANS accuracy \\ncompared to DNS data and to identify regions where RANS simulations \\nfail while deep neural networks ( Ling et al., 2016a ) were used to model \\nthe Reynolds stress anisotropy eigenvalues. These approaches are \\nlimited because they cannot be applied to new flow configurations since \\nthey use shallow neural networks with one or two layers. Later on, Ling \\nFig. 1.

(2016b) developed a deep neural network (8 – 10 layers) able to \\npredict the full anisotropy tensor. The same approach was used in other \\nresearch works ( Zhao et al., 2020 ). Alternatively, new terms (time and \\nspace-dependent) were added to the turbulence transport equations \\n(mainly production) and are learned directly from data ( Zhang and \\nDuraisamy, 2015 ; Wang et al., 2017 ; Wu et al., 2018 ). \\n2.1.2. Application of deep learning in the thermal-hydraulic system codes \\nSeveral system thermal-hydraulics codes have been developed over \\nthe years to simulate the transient characteristics of nuclear power \\nplants. These codes provide the best-estimate analysis of nuclear reactor \\ntransient conditions, and they are based on the conservation equations \\nfor two-phase flow which are resolved in Eulerian coordinates. Examples \\nof such best-estimate thermal-hydraulic codes are RELAP ( R eactor \\nE xcursion and L eak A nalysis P rogram), TRAC ( T ransient R eactor \\nA nalysis C ode), ATHLET ( A nalysis of TH ermal-hydraulics of LE aks and \\nT ransients), etc. Traditionally, these codes operate in an iterative mode \\nwhich requires the repetition of calculation, evaluation, and corrections \\nsteps. The entire process could be very tedious and takes a lot of \\ncomputational time. The successful application of DL techniques in \\nseveral fields has awoken serious interest in new data-driven in -\\nnovations for the thermal-hydraulic design of nuclear reactor systems. \\nFor instance, the thermal-hydraulic parameters of the two key compo -\\nnents (reactor core and tube-in-tube-through steam generator) of a nu -\\nclear reactor (KLT-40 S) were predicted using a DL algorithm ( Lu et al., \\n2021a ). The RELAP code was used to generate data for the training of \\nthe DL model and the prediction of the thermal-hydraulic parameters \\nusing the trained DL model was able to reproduce RELAP results in a \\nvery rapid manner. Many studies ( Tian et al., 2018 ; Kim et al., 2019 ; \\nSaeed et al., 2020 ) have been performed in recent times using \\nthermal-hydraulic system code to generate data for the training of deep \\nlearning models that can be used for the diagnostics, fault-monitoring, \\nand prediction of thermal-hydraulic parameters of nuclear reactors in \\na more efficient and timely manner. \\nIn addition, the DL model can also be used to complement thermal- \\nhydraulic system codes to improve their predictive accuracies. This has \\nbeen demonstrated in previous work ( Guillen et al., 2020 ) where a \\nlong-short term memory (LSTM) deep neural network model was used to \\ncomplement RELAP code for the analysis of the failures of two drywell \\ncooling fans in a nuclear power plant. The RELAP code was used to \\nsimulate four fan coil units (FCUs) each of which comprises a \\nwater-cooled heat exchanger and a centrifugal fan. The results (outlet \\ntemperature of the FCUs) of the RELAP simulation of the FCUs using the \\nmeasured FCU inlet temperature as input was compared with that of \\nLSTM-generated inlet temperature as input. The predicted outlet tem -\\nperatures using measured FCU inlet temperature and LSTM-generated \\ninlet temperature fall within 7.35% and 5.16% of the reported values \\nby the plant process information system, respectively. Thus, the use of \\nRELAP5-3D with the LSTM model provides a better physics-based \\nanomaly detection model for the drywell FCUs. \\nThe DL techniques can also be used for severe accident analysis in \\nnuclear power plants. Severe accidents are nuclear accidents that are \\nbeyond design basis accidents (DBA) that involve substantial core \\ndamage due to melting. An example of this accident is the Fukushima \\nnuclear power accident of 2011. Although, this kind of accident has a \\nvery low probability of occurrence recent event of Fukushima has shown \\nthat it can nonetheless happen. Thus, safety analysis of nuclear reactors \\nis also performed under this kind of rare accident scenario. The pro -\\ngression of a severe accident encapsulates several complex interdepen -\\ndent phenomena ( Kang et al., 2004 ; Henry and Fauske, 1993 ; \\nTheofanous and Syri, 1997 ; Zhang et al., 2010 ; Amidu et al., 2021 ) and \\nDL application to severe accident analysis could be very beneficial. For \\ninstance, Koo et al. ( Do Koo et al., 2019 ) have used a deep neural \\nnetwork to predict the reactor vessel water level during a severe acci -\\ndent scenario in a nuclear power plant. The water level in the reactor \\nvessel is one of the parameters that are monitored during a severe \\naccident since it is directly connected to the reactor coolability and \\nmitigation of core exposure. To train the deep neural network, modular \\naccident analysis program (MAAP) code was used to simulate postulated \\nloss of coolant accident (LOCA) at hot legs and cold legs, and steam \\ngenerator tube rupture. This deep neural network was found to have \\nsmall RMSE (root mean square error) in the predicted reactor vessel \\nwater level and superior performance over the cascaded fuzzy neural \\nnetwork was also observed. With this DL model, supporting information \\non reactor vessel water levels can be provided to plant operators to aid \\ntheir management of the severe accident progression especially when \\nthe instrumentation signals from the nuclear power plant cannot be \\naccurately acquired due to instrumentation damage under severe acci -\\ndent condition. \\nFurthermore, DL methods can also be used to aid nuclear power plant \\noperators in the implementation of severe accident management \\nguidelines (SAMG). This way, the decision-making by the operators as \\nthe severe accident progress can be expedited. For example, an operator \\nsupport tool (OST) based on the DL technique has been proposed by Lee \\net al. (2020) to aid operators in decision-making. The data-driven OST \\nmodel was trained using the data generated from dynamic probabilistic \\nsafety/risk assessment (DPSA/DPRA) of station blackout (SBO) of a \\npressurized water reactor. The data generation process combines three \\nsimulation codes: dynamic event tree (DET) generator, MELCOR (acci -\\ndent simulator), and radiological assessment system for consequence \\nanalysis (RASCAL). Subsequently, the data-driven OST was able to \\npredict possible offsite doses at 2-mile and 10-mile radius for emergency \\nresponse planning. \\nNotably acknowledging the significance of DL in the nuclear field, \\nseveral ML/DL libraries have been integrated into a Risk Analysis Virtual \\nEnvironment (RAVEN) framework, a tool developed by Idaho National \\nLaboratory ( Rabiti et al., 2021 ). The RAVEN code provides a modular \\nand pluggable environment for different programming languages (py -\\nthon, c ++ , etc) and several thermal-hydraulic and severe accident codes \\nsuch as MELCOR, RELAP7, MAAP5, TRACE, RATTLESNAKE, \\nMAMMOTH, SCALE, etc ( Alfonsi et al., 2022 ). In addition, RAVEN has \\ninterfaces for several ML/DL libraries but the one that is very relevant to \\nthe subject of this article is the TensorFlow-Keras Deep Neural Networks. \\nThus, with RAVEN, data-driven closure models can easily be deployed in \\nmany thermal-hydraulic and severe accident codes. \\n2.1.3. Application of deep learning in multiphase heat transfer phenomena \\nPrediction of multiphase heat transfer phenomena is another key \\ncomponent of the thermal-hydraulic analysis of a nuclear power system. \\nSuch phenomena are nucleate boiling ( Hari and Hassan, 2002 ; Dhir, \\n2006 ; Podowski, 2012 ; Yoo et al., 2014 ; Amidu et al., 2018 ; Amidu, \\n2021 ), and critical heat flux (CHF) conditions ( Katto, 1994 ; Liang and \\nMudawar, 2018 ; Devahdhanush and Mudawar, 2021 ; Lu et al., 2021b ). \\nThese phenomena are germane to the determination of thermal design \\nlimits that need to be imposed to maintain the integrity of the cladding \\nin the fuel rod. As an illustration, the CHF phenomenon results from a \\nrelatively abrupt deterioration of the heat transfer capability of the \\ntwo-phase coolant, and the resulting thermal design limit is expressed in \\nterms of the departure from nucleate boiling (DNB) for pressurized \\nwater reactors (PWRs) and critical power (CP) condition for boiling \\nwater reactors (BWRs). The significance of CHF has elicited extensive \\nexperimental and theoretical studies over several years. Many predictive \\ntools for CHF, ranging from empirical correlations and look-up tables \\n(LUTs) to physics-driven mechanistic models have been suggested in the \\nliterature. However, most of these empirical correlations are specific to \\nexperimental datasets from which they were derived and most of the \\ntime could not be used for different systems outside their range of val -\\nidities. Thus, DL techniques can be leveraged to achieve better predic -\\ntion of these phenomena instead of empirical correlations. The use of \\nDFNN for the prediction of CHF has been presented in several relevant \\nprevious studies ( Nafey, 2009 ; Cong et al., 2013 ; Moon et al., 1996 ; Su \\net al., 2002 ). Unfortunately, these studies neither differentiated DNB \\nA. Ayodeji et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 '), Document(metadata={'source': 'docs/2022_Deep Learning for Safety Assessment of Nuclear Power Reactors.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='Progress in Nuclear Energy 151 (2022) 104339\\n6\\nfrom dryout when selecting data sources nor assessed their deep \\nlearning network architecture through cross-validation techniques. \\nTo address the deficiency of previous application of DFNN to DNB, a \\nmechanistic CHF model (based on the concept of liquid sublayer dryout \\nand bubble crowding) was incorporated as the physics-informed \\ncomponent of the physics-informed machine learning-aided frame -\\nwork (PIMLAF) to obtain a superior prediction of DNB for a rod bundle \\n( Zhao et al., 2021b ). This way, DL leverages the domain knowledge in \\nthe field to capture the undiscovered information from the mismatch \\nbetween the actual and domain knowledge predicted output. This \\nhybrid framework (PIMLAF) was able to predict DNB in varieties of \\nheater geometries covering a wide range of flow conditions without \\nrecalibration of the model. With this framework, experimental data or \\nhigh-fidelity numerical data can be leveraged to achieve reduced ther -\\nmal margin in the minimum DBN ratio (MDNBR) for reactor designs. \\n2.2. Reactor core neutronic, fuel loading optimization, and spent fuel \\nstorage \\nThe reactor core neutronic analysis is customarily carried out using \\neither high-fidelity approaches (such as method of characteristics, \\nMonte Carlo method, and finite element method) or low-fidelity \\nmethods such as the nodal diffusion approach. The high-fidelity simu -\\nlation of light water reactor neutronic requires high computing power \\nand may take several days to complete. Whereas the low-fidelity \\nmethods do not need much computational capability as they are inten -\\nded to run on personal computers but they provide low-level detail of \\nthe neutronic characteristics. For design optimization, this low-fidelity \\nmethod (diffusion method) is conservative enough to estimate reactor \\ncore parameters at a low computational cost. Since the low-fidelity \\nmethod is desirable for design optimization, DL techniques can be \\nused to leverage a high-level detail provided by the high-fidelity method \\nfor the enhancement of the low-fidelity approach to achieve the best \\nestimate of the core neutronic parameters. In light of this, a DL archi -\\ntecture based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) was proposed by \\nShrivel et al. ( Shriver et al., 2021 ) to predict the normalized pin powers \\nand k\\neff \\nof a two-dimensional reflective pressurized water reactor as -\\nsembly model. In their study, the data generated and used for training \\nthe DL model was based on a 2-D hot-zero-power infinite fuel lattice \\nwith several pin geometries and materials compositions. A high-fidelity \\nsimulation was performed with VERA (virtual environment for reactor \\napplications) code suits to obtain the training dataset. The DL model \\npredicts the neutronic parameters with high accuracy (high-fidelity) but \\nat a low computational cost. Similarly, Jinyoung and Yongduk \\n( Jinyoung and Younduk, 2019 ) have used very deep CNN to predict \\nassembly powers and individual pin powers by interpolating on pre -\\ncomputed form factor tables which makes it different from Shrivel et al. \\n( Shriver et al., 2021 ) approach where these high-fidelity features (in -\\ndividual pin powers) are predicted without any pre-computed libraries. \\nThe deep learning techniques have also found application in the \\nestimation of neutronic parameters of high-dimensional large nuclear \\nreactors. Due to the heterogeneity of large nuclear reactor cores (e.g. \\nboiling water reactors) in terms of the composition of the fuel, insertion \\nof the control rod, and flow regimes, high order symmetry are not \\npossible which estimates the neutronic parameters for large spaces of \\npossible loading patterns difficult. This challenge can be resolved using \\nthe DL method. To this end, Saleem et al. (2020) have used a deep neural \\nnetwork trained and optimized using a combination of manual and \\nGaussian processes, for the prediction of neutronic parameters (power \\npeaking factor, control rod bank level, and cycle length) of Ringhal-1 \\nBWR unit. The training data were generated by Purdue Advanced \\nReactor Core Simulator (PARCS) code applied to the half-symmetry core \\nby shuffling 196 fuel assemblies. The deep neural network performed \\ncreditably well with absolute errors of ~0.2, ~0.2, and ~0.5 for \\nmaximum, radially averaged, and axially averaged power peaking fac -\\ntors, respectively. \\nIn addition, the application of the DL method has also been extended \\nto the nuclear fuel transmutation in a fuel cycle as a flexible, quick, and \\nmedium-fidelity method to predict the PWR spent fuel composition with \\ntime-varying burnup and enrichment. The deep neural network was \\ntrained using the Used Nuclear Fuel Storage, Transportation & Disposal \\nAnalysis Resource and Data System (UNF-ST & DARDS) Unified Database \\n(UDB) as the ground truth ( Bae et al., 2020 ). The trained deep neural \\nnetwork was very quick taking about 0.27 s for 100 predictions with \\nvery good accuracy (1% error for used nuclear fuel inventory decay heat \\nand 2% error for major isotopic inventory). A balance between high fi -\\ndelity and speed of calculation can be reached with a well-trained deep \\nneural network. This is crucial because most nuclear fuel cycle simula -\\ntors using high-fidelity models face prohibitive computation expenses \\non one hand, while simpler and quicker methods do not provide \\nhigh-level detailed calculations. \\n3. Demonstration of a deep learning model for RANS simulation \\noptimization \\nTo demonstrate the applicability of physics-separated DL algorithms \\nfor robust RANS simulation, this section presents a deep feedforward \\nneural network (DFNN) model for the prediction of turbulent eddy- \\nviscosity and its integration for optimal RANS simulation. The python \\nframework used is Tensorflow 1.14 with C-backend, integrated into \\nOpenFOAM 5.0. The physics-separated development framework for the \\nDL-based closure model is used in this demonstration, as illustrated in \\nFig. 2 ( Chang and Dinh, 2019 ). This demonstration also follows the 2D \\nbackward-facing workflow presented by Maulik et al. (2021) , as shown \\nin Fig. 3 . The purpose of this demonstration is to show the improvement \\nof DL-based RANS simulation, as opposed to solving an additional par -\\ntial differential equation to close the Spalart Allmaras model in RANS \\nsimulation. A widely tested flow configuration passing over a \\nbackward-facing step is used to generate steady-state turbulent eddy \\nviscosities data in RANS simulation using a one-equation Spalart All -\\nmaras model as a closure. These data are subsequently used to train the \\nDFNN. The equation of the Spalart Allmaras utilized can be found in \\nSpalart and Allmaras (1992) . To perform this RANS simulation, a solver \\n(simpleFoam in OpenFOAM 5.0) is used in this study. \\nUsing the configuration shown in Fig. 2 , airflow over the backward \\nstep is simulated for Reynolds number ( Re ) determined by the step \\nheight ( h ) which is fixed at 1.27 cm, and the free stream velocity. The \\ndefinition of the Reynolds number is given in Eq.

However, simulated datasets \\nface certain reliability challenges, which invariably constrain the \\ngeneralization and utility of such datasets. First, the value and ultimate \\nreliability of a particular simulated dataset depend on the subjective \\nexperience, acquisition framework, and application expertise of the \\nmodeler. Secondly, the static nature of simulated data may not reflect \\nthe composition and dynamics in real-world systems. \\nSeveral open-source simulation data for thermal fluid flow are \\navailable. However, the data are not standardized for DL model training, \\nand there are no suitable benchmarked results to evaluate the perfor -\\nmance of various DL architectures on the dataset. Although costly, \\nexperimental data from expert evaluators would still perform a signifi -\\ncant role in providing curated input to DL models. This is supported by \\nthe fact that some repositories with simulated data are unlabeled and \\nrequire significant preprocessing to be useful for model development. \\nConsidering the size of data needed for developing a robust DL algo -\\nrithm, some repositories contain inadequate data size to train a robust \\nDL model. Although this work does not attempt to compare the reli -\\nability of the available data, a casual study shows that the open-source \\nsimulated dataset is not sufficiently representative, and heterogeneity \\nrequirements are not defined. This needs to be addressed for the appli -\\ncation of DL models to achieve its full potential, especially in tasks \\ninvolving data-driven closure models in RANS simulation and other \\nreactor safety analysis problems. \\nAnother major performance controller in DL training is the data \\nsampling and reconstruction method utilized, as the input to DL models \\nare prone to uncertainties. Data sampling refers to the method used to \\nselect a (sub)set of a big dataset to ensure speedy model convergence \\nand reduce computational cost. Data reconstruction refers to the method \\nused in obtaining desired properties in a particular dataset. Data sam -\\npling and reconstruction are also necessary to correct imbalance distri -\\nbution in dataset, for sensitivity analysis, and to reduce uncertainty. A \\nnumber of data sampling methods such as the random sampling (i.e. grid \\nsampling and Monte Carlo approach), cluster sampling, stochastic \\ncollocation approach and adaptive methods such as stratified sampling, \\nimportance sampling, Latin hypercube approach and their variants have \\nbeen proposed to reduce sampling error and to ensure that the data \\nsubset used for training adequately represent the whole data. Detailed \\ndiscussion of the sampling methods and data reconstructions approaches \\nare discussed in ( Katharopoulos and Fleuret, 2018 ). Also, the impor -\\ntance of data reconstruction for DL models is discussed in ( Liu et al., \\n2021 ). Further, section 4.2 below discusses model reliability and un -\\ncertainty quantification approaches useful for improved DL model \\nperformance. \\n4.2. Model reliability and uncertainty quantification \\nThe reliability concerns that emanate from insufficient data often \\nprompts the use of simulated datasets and their associated static nature. \\nThere are also reliability issues caused by internal structural defects of \\nDL with significant effects ( Zhang and Xiao, 2020 ). Reliability issues \\ncould also cause a small transformation (rotations or translations) in the \\ninput to have a significant influence on the classification result ( Azulay \\nand Weiss, 2018 ). This section discusses the reliability and uncertainty \\nconcerns in DL models and the strategies for improving the reliability of \\nthe DL-based reactor safety analysis. \\n4.2.1. Reliability concerns \\nReliable predictions through DL could greatly facilitate their utili -\\nzation in safety-critical applications. An extensive study by Zhang and \\nXiao (2020) reveals that the reliability of DNNs has attracted serious \\nattention due to potential structural defects in DL. Reliability translates \\nto effective performance, and safe operation of complex systems (such as \\nnuclear reactors and related installations) is crucial. Hence, the \\ndata-driven approach is increasingly being introduced to enhance the \\nsafety, reliability, and availability of nuclear systems. DL-based methods \\nare now being applied to key nuclear safety fields such as systems health \\nmonitoring and control, radiation detection, and optimization \\n( Gomez-Fernandez et al., 2020 ). Thus, the reliability of DL applications \\nrequires careful consideration. \\nGenerally, there are many factors that affect complex systems ’ per -\\nformances that are necessary for consideration in reliability analysis. \\nSome of the factors include human reliability factors, equipment, ma -\\nterials, the environment, and the management procedures ( Zhao et al., \\n2020 ). The issues associated with those factors are continuously being \\nresolved through different strategies and approaches to which DL is also \\na significant contributor, as DL is currently the most advanced method in \\nartificial intelligence ( Szegedy et al., 2013 ). \\nThree primary factors that often affect the reliability of the DL \\nmodels are ( Krizhevsky et al., 2012 ):  \\n● the input-output mapping discontinuity caused by the deep neural \\nnetwork model ’ s nonlinearity.  \\n● the over-fitting caused by the inefficient model training; and  \\n● insufficient regularization. \\nDifferent external contributors to reduce the reliability of DL models \\nare extensively discussed in Zhang and Xiao (2020) which include \\nadversarial attacks that should be carefully studied. Details about the \\ndifferent types of attacks and the possible mitigating approaches were \\nalso discussed in Zhang and Xiao (2020) . Several novel contributions are \\nbeing made to improve the reliability of DL models and frameworks over \\ntime. Among them is the study by Zhang et al. (2019) which proposed a \\nnew class of reliability analysis methods that needs no simulation data. \\nThe method is based on recent advances in DL and adopts tools such as \\nautomatic differentiation. With the method, the unknown response is \\nrepresented by a DL model and a physics-informed loss function can be \\nused to obtain the unknown parameters. With the loss function, there is \\nno need for training data and the neural network parameters are directly \\ncomputed through the ordinary differential equation and partial dif -\\nferential equation (ODE/PDE) that describe the system. Because simu -\\nlation data is not required, the computational cost associated with \\nreliability analysis is greatly reduced. In addition, since the network \\nparameters are trained by using a physics-informed loss function, the \\nneural network solutions observe the physical principles (e.g., the con -\\nservation laws). Furthermore, the method provides prediction at every \\nspatial and temporal location which makes it very appropriate for \\nhandling time-dependent reliability analysis. \\n4.2.2. Uncertainty quantification \\n4.2.2.1. Uncertainty quantification: sources and types of uncertainty. A \\nmismatch of the test and training data is the main source of uncertainty \\nin DL, while data uncertainty occurs because of the class overlap or the \\npresence of noise in the data. However, estimating knowledge uncer -\\ntainty is much more difficult than estimating data uncertainty. In gen -\\neral, two broad types of uncertainty exist which are aleatory and \\nepistemic uncertainties ( Hüllermeier and Waegeman, 2021 ). The irre -\\nducible uncertainty in data that gives rise to uncertainty in predictions is \\nthe aleatory uncertainty which is also referred to as data uncertainty. \\nAleatory uncertainty is not associated with the characteristics of the \\nmodel, but rather it is an inherent property of the data distribution, and \\nthus, irreducible. In contrast, epistemic uncertainty (also known as \\nknowledge uncertainty) occurs due to inadequate knowledge. More \\ndetailed background, discussion, and insights into these two broad \\ngroups of uncertainty were given in a generalized form to engineering \\nsystems in Zhang and Olatubosun (2019) and Abdar et al. (2021) . The \\npredictive uncertainty, as applicable to DL, is therefore a combination of \\nthe two broad categories of uncertainty, viz: \\nPredictive uncertainty ( PU )\\nA.

The \\nuncertainty quantification in DL-based applications is thus essential as \\nthe various uncertainty quantification methods adopted in conjunction \\nwith different DL techniques can significantly raise the integrity of their \\nresults ( Abdar et al., 2021 ). A more robust framework for classifying the \\nsources of uncertainty based on a detailed review of uncertainty analysis \\nin different fields was given by Radaideh and Kozlowski (2019) . The \\nclassification framework is generic, concise, and captures most of the \\nuncertainties applicable in nuclear engineering and reactor safety spe -\\ncifically. Based on the classification, five major categories were identi -\\nfied and discussed in detail ( Radaideh and Kozlowski, 2019 ), which are \\nnow summarized using Table 2 . Furthermore, based on the different \\nsources of uncertainty (as highlighted in Table 2 ), equation (3) can be \\nexplicitly defined as: \\nPU ( as applicable to DL ) = EU\\n⎛\\n⎝\\nsurrogate uncertainty ,\\nmodel \\x00 form uncertainty ,\\nmodel deficiency\\n⎞\\n⎠\\n+ AU\\n(\\nParametric and input uncertainty ,\\noutput uncertainty\\n)\\n(4) \\nThe essential literature gaps and open issues in the application of \\nuncertainty quantification methods are extensively discussed in Abdar \\net al. (2021) and further related gaps are presented in ( Mashlakov et al., \\n2021 ). \\n4.2.2.2. Uncertainty quantification of deep learning models and methods. \\nThe results (predictions) obtained from the application of DL often fail to \\nprovide the reliability or confidence level of such predictions despite the \\nseveral advantages associated with the DL-based approaches, especially \\nwhen applied to proffer solutions to practical problems ( Radaideh and \\nKozlowski, 2019 ). To resolve this issue, interpretation of the model \\nparameters is often carried out using Bayesian deep learning (BDL) and \\nBayesian neural networks (BNNs) ( Foong et al., 2019 ). Both BNNs and \\nBDL are resourceful in handling overfitting problems and can be trained \\non both small and large datasets ( Kucukelbir et al., 2017 ). \\nSince wrong predictions can be disastrous in critical applications \\nsuch as nuclear power reactors, it is pertinent to properly handle un -\\ncertainty quantification, especially for practical applications ( Lakshmi -\\nnarayanan et al., 2016 ). The integrity of predictive uncertainty \\nevaluation is tasking as there is no empirical evidence of uncertainty \\nestimates in general in most cases ( Abdar et al., 2021 ). Calibration and \\ndomain shift are the two common uncertainty evaluation measures often \\napplied and are usually inspired by the practical applications of neural \\nnetworks. Calibration measures the discrepancy between long-run fre -\\nquencies and subjective forecasts. Another thought generalizes predic -\\ntive uncertainty to a domain shift that estimates whether the network \\nunder study knows what it knows ( Abdar et al., 2021 ). \\nUncertainty quantification methods, therefore, help in drastically \\nreducing the effect of uncertainties, especially in optimization and \\ndecision-making in most fields. Bayesian approximation and ensemble \\nlearning techniques are two widely adopted types of uncertainty quan -\\ntification methods. Abdar et al. (2021) presented in detail the recent \\nadvances in the uncertainty quantification methods used in DL, in -\\nvestigates the application of these methods in reinforcement learning \\nand highlights fundamental research challenges and future research \\ndirections in uncertainty quantification. \\nSeveral other novel contributions have been made to address the \\nissues of uncertainty quantification in DL. An extensive comparison of \\nthe common methods for uncertainty quantification was made in Cal -\\ndeira and Nord (2020) in which BNNs, concrete dropout (CD), and deep \\nensembles (DEs) are compared to the standard analytic error propaga -\\ntion. The issues with the adoption of these methods were highlighted \\nwhich include when the variation of noise in the training set is small, all \\nmethods predicted the same relative uncertainty irrespective of the in -\\nputs. This issue is particularly hard to avoid in BNN. On the other hand, \\nwhen the test set contains samples far from the training distribution, no \\nmethods sufficiently increased the uncertainties associated with their \\npredictions. This issue was particularly glaring with CD. The results \\nobtained by Caldeira and Nord (2020) informed the following recom -\\nmendations for handling uncertainty issues in DL-based reactor safety \\nanalysis:  \\n● To obtain an accurate estimate of aleatoric statistical uncertainty, \\nthere must be a sufficiently wide variation of the noise present in the \\ntraining set. This will prevent the model from being stuck by \\navoiding the prediction of the same relative uncertainty for all \\npoints.  \\n● For systematic uncertainties, the model can only infer the typical \\nuncertainty in each region of inputs from the training set, since the \\nuncertainty cannot be statistically derived from the inputs.  \\n● For epistemic uncertainties, all methods failed to detect the extents \\nto which the inputs had moved from the training distribution. Spe -\\ncifically, CD converged to a very low dropout probability in training, \\nwhich makes it capable of predicting very low epistemic un -\\ncertainties. While DE and BNN could be used to detect out-of- \\ndistribution data, their quantitative estimates of epistemic uncer -\\ntainty are not reliable for that case. \\n● DE was recommended as the best approach as its results are com -\\nparable to the best in all the experiments, which also corroborates \\nthe existing findings ( Ovadia et al., 2019 ). \\nTable 2 \\nGeneralized uncertainty sources.   \\nSource of \\nuncertainty \\nCategory of \\nuncertainty \\nBrief description Examples \\n1 Parametric and \\ninput \\nuncertainty \\nAleatory \\nuncertainty \\nThe most common \\nand most analyzed \\nuncertainty.

Model output explainability \\nDL model explainability refers to the ability of the model to relate the \\nfeature values to the predicted output for a particular instance in an \\ninterpretable manner. Explainability defines the model characteristics \\nthat enable interpretable output, and improved trust in the model pre -\\ndiction. Moreover, the unexplained model output results in an incom -\\nplete problem formalization, creating a fundamental barrier to \\noptimization and evaluation ( Doshi-Velez and Kim, 2017 ). Current \\nexplainability approaches are divided into two: gradient-based and \\nperturbation-based. The working principles, computational complexity, \\nand the essential properties of interpretability in the DL model are dis -\\ncussed in Robnik-\\nˇ\\nSikonja and Bohanec (2018) . \\nIn the reactor safety analysis, the importance of explainability is \\nevident. First, the high-risk, safety-critical nuclear environment de -\\nmands proven techniques, as the consequences of wrong predictions are \\nsignificant. Moreover, implementing black box models would inherently \\nconstrain the DL applications in practical reactor analysis. Also, tech -\\nnologies based on black-box models may delay reactor licensing \\napproval. Besides, explainability is critical in quantifying the un -\\ncertainties and failure modes of DL models. Considering the complexity \\ninvolved in reactor development, and the strong coupling of multiple \\ncodes for safety analysis, interpretable DL modeling is critical to un -\\nderstanding the coupling effect on other components and for effective \\nsafety verification. \\nTo improve trust in model outputs, shapely additive explanations \\n(SHAP) ( Lundberg and Lee, 2017 ), and local interpretable \\nmodel-agnostic explanations ( LIME ) ( Ribeiro et al., 2016 ), are two \\ncommonly-used tools. SHAP ’ s capacity to explain the predictors ’ rela -\\ntionship with the target (global interpretability) and LIME ’ s value-based \\nexplanation of prediction from each predictor (local interpretability) is \\nimportant to understand local phenomena in the reactor safety analysis. \\nThe global interpretations provided by SHAP explain the input features \\nand the entire model relationship with the prediction, which is an \\napproximation. The LIME ’ s local interpretation explains the model \\npredictions for a single observation or groups of observations from any \\nML model. The two tools incorporate advanced visualizations that aid \\nmodel interpretability, a critical characteristic in reactor safety appli -\\ncations. To demonstrate the importance of advanced explainability tools \\nin DL-based reactor safety analysis, sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2 below \\ndiscuss the global and local interpretation of the output from the DFNN \\nsurrogate model presented in section 3 . \\n4.3.1. Feature importance estimation with shapely additive explanation \\n(SHAP) metric \\nShapely Additive Explanation (SHAP) is a python-based library that \\nuses shapely values in cooperative game theory. The API is used to \\ndefine the optimum contribution of each feature to the marginal devi -\\nation in model output. The library is used to interpret black-box models \\nfor which predictions are known. The explainers in the SHAP library are \\none of the most common tools for a global and local explanation of each \\nfeature ’ s contribution to the model prediction, although SHAP computes \\nall permutations globally to get local accuracy. The SHAP library has \\nbeen used to interpret DL model output in both classification and \\nregression tasks, and the explanation is specified as: \\ng ( z\\n’\\n) = ∅\\no\\n∑\\nM\\nj = 1\\n∅\\nj\\n(5)  \\nWhere g is the explanation model, z\\n′\\n∈ { 0 , 1 }\\nM\\nis the simplified features, \\nM is the maximum coalition size and ∅\\nj\\n∈ R is the feature attribute for \\ninput j . A detailed description of the SHAP library can be found in \\nLundberg and Lee (2020) and Molnar (2020) . \\nThis section utilizes the SHAP tool to rank the features that \\ncontribute to the DFNN predictions in the RANS closure surrogate model \\npresented in section 3 . The demonstration utilizes a similar framework \\nused to develop the model obtained in section 3 . Then SHAP functions \\nare used to estimate the contributions of the horizontal velocity, vertical \\nvelocity, horizontal component, vertical component, and the step height \\nto the model prediction. Because of the training set size, the dataset was \\nsummarized with a set of weighted average values. For global inter -\\npretation, the SHAP KernelExplainer takes the trained model and the \\nsummarized training set as input. The output is the explainer that serves \\nas the input to estimate expected SHAP values. Thereafter, the shap. \\nsummary_plot function is used to visualize all the DFNN model pre -\\ndictions in the test set. The SHAP summary plot describing the feature \\nimportance is shown in Fig. 8 . \\nFig. 8 above ranks the importance of each feature to the model \\npredictions. The Figure shows that the most important feature for pre -\\ndicting turbulent eddy viscosity is the vertical components ( y\\nc\\n) and the \\nhorizontal components ( x\\nc\\n) respectively. This is closely followed by the \\nhorizontal velocity ( u\\nx\\n), the step height ( h ) and vertical velocity ( u\\ny\\n). \\nThe demonstration shows the effect of the vertical and horizontal \\ncomponents in turbulent eddy viscosity prediction, useful for improved \\nRANS closure modeling, and to further the understanding of the \\nthermal-hydraulic phenomena in the reactor core. \\n4.3.2. Local prediction explanations with LIME API \\nFeature importance estimated with SHAP in section 4.3.1 explains \\nthe global contribution of each feature to the DFNN predictions. How -\\never, it does not give insight into the average direction that a feature \\naffects a prediction for a particular observation. To further explain the \\nDFNN model prediction, the local interpretable model-agnostic expla -\\nnations ( LIME ) API is used to interpret the local prediction of the DFNN \\nmodel. LIME explains model prediction through local approximation \\nwith an interpretable surrogate model, by perturbing data around an \\nindividual prediction to build the model. \\nSimilar experimental settings and frameworks used for the SHAP \\ndemonstration in section 4.3.1 are retained. First, the DFNN model is \\nused to predict the first one hundred inputs in the test set. This is used to \\nspecify the observation for which explanation is required. Then, the \\nLIME distinguishes an interpretable representation from the original \\nfeature space used by the DFNN. This is achieved with LIME ’ s Lime -\\nTabularExplainer function, an explainer that takes the training set and \\nfeature names as key input parameters. Then the function explainer. \\nexplain_instances is used to explain a particular observation in the test \\ndataset to get their probability values for each prediction. Then LIME \\nassigns probability, provides an explanation as to the reason for \\nassigning the probability, and compares the probability values to the \\nactual value of the target variable for that prediction. \\nThe first prediction in the test set is used as the observation of in -\\nterest to demonstrate the tool and for a legible explanation. LIME per -\\nturbs the data by sampling from N ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) and scaling the data according \\nto the means and standard deviations in the training set. Fig. 9 and \\nFig. 10 show how LIME ranks the features according to their contribu -\\ntion to the observed local prediction at indices 200 and 5000 respec -\\ntively. For the 200th local variable (index-200), the LIME output \\nexplains each feature contribution to or against the observed local \\nFig. 8.

For a particular local variable, the feature that in -\\ncreases the prediction probability is indicated by a green bar to the right, \\nwith a positive feature value, while the feature that decreases the pre -\\ndiction probability is indicated by a red bar to the left, with a negative \\nfeature value.

Apart from interpreting results from surrogate closure models, \\nLIME and SHAP are critical tools useful for explaining different outputs \\nin DL-based reactor safety analysis. The tools are also useful for the \\nassessment of relationships between experimental features and nuclear \\nmetadata, to capture systematic bias and outliers in nuclear data, among \\nothers. \\n5. Research opportunities/future direction \\nAlthough modern DL architectures have the potential to improve \\nreactor safety analysis, their proper application requires not only a well- \\ncurated dataset, but also a deep understanding of the domain, and a \\nknowledge-driven representation of the problem. Moreover, the com -\\nmon drawbacks of DL – such as its inability to produce dynamic repre -\\nsentation and flexible inference mechanism – also provide future \\ndirection and research opportunities. For instance, the explainability \\ntools presented above are interesting solutions to the black box problem \\nof DL. Also, the legacy reactor analysis codes embody generations of \\nwork from experts and renewing the codes and incorporating DL-based \\nsolutions is an exciting research opportunity. Other research opportu -\\nnities and potential future directions are discussed in this section. \\nOver the years, empirical or semi-mechanistic correlations derived \\nfrom experimental observations have been used as closure relations in \\nthe RANS model. However, the traditional method of developing these \\nempirical correlations is expensive. Also, the resultant closure term may \\nbe limited by the conditions and configurations of the experiments from \\nwhich they are derived. These deficiencies hamper the application of the \\ncomputational fluid dynamics methods in simulating new systems con -\\nditions and configurations. For researchers with access to big experi -\\nmental/simulation data, DL models are feasible substitutes. DL \\nalgorithms could reveal the functional relations of features in big \\nexperimental data. The resulting DL closure model can be employed \\ninstead of the traditional empirical or semi-mechanistic closure \\napproach. For instance, turbulence remains one of the oldest physics \\nproblems not yet solved or well understood, due to the nonlinear \\nbehavior of the governing (Navier-Stoke) equations. A wide range of \\nscales (spatial and temporal) are generated during a turbulent flow, and \\nthey present the major barrier to solving the fluid flow problem either \\nexperimentally or numerically. DL models can reconstruct fully resolved \\nturbulent flows, optimize the simulation and replace conventional \\nmodel tuning and calibrations. Additionally, DL models can be used to \\ndetermine optimum selections of mesh size and models in coarse mesh \\nCFD codes to reduce the errors due to simplifying assumptions and \\nmathematical approximation. \\nFurther, research that utilizes DL algorithms to predict the properties \\nof appropriate sacrificial materials for in-vessel core catchers would \\nprovide an exciting approach to severe accident management. DL \\nmodels can also be utilized for uncertainty quantification and Bayesian \\nsystem updating by developing a learning-based parametric model to \\nlearn functional relations using the aleatory and epistemic parameters as \\ninputs. DL algorithms can also be utilized to predict parameters of a \\nBayesian probability distribution, detect bias, and identify outliers in \\nboth experimental and simulated nuclear data. The data validation \\ncapability of the DL algorithm provides recursive advantages. That is, DL \\nalgorithm output could be applied to detect imperfections in the input \\ndeck, replace manual data comparison, provide cost-effective nuclear \\ndata evaluation, detect discrepancies in differential experimental data, \\nand produce a robust dataset for advanced DL modeling. DL algorithms \\nare also valuable for criticality benchmarking and to maximize sensi -\\ntivity with the least code execution. \\nDL algorithms are also useful in estimating the effective neutron \\nmultiplication factor (K\\neff\\n) and fission mass yield of nuclear materials \\nwith full posterior distributions without making assumptions about the \\nshape of the posterior distribution. Many K\\neff \\ncatalogs are known to have \\nbiased inputs and DL algorithms can predict the K\\neff \\nbias in the reactor of \\ninterest. In addition, DL models can be used to study the spatio-temporal \\nbehavior of neutrons in the reactor core. The attributes of message- \\npassing graph neural networks can be leveraged to model fixed source \\nand criticality neutron transport, and to study effective neutron distri -\\nbution in complex geometries. DL models can also be used to optimize \\nboth deterministic and probabilistic neutron transport codes, using the \\nframework provided in section 3 . \\nPerturbation localization in nuclear reactors is another exciting \\napplication of DL algorithms. DL models can also be developed to detect \\nfluctuations in neutron flux, and to identify, localize and size fluctuation \\nin the reactor core. DL algorithms can be used to predict neutron energy, \\ndetect effective fission cross-section for new fuel materials, measure \\ngamma spectrum, and predict in-core radioactive material activities for \\nchannel and energy ranges where data is not available. \\nDL models are also useful in detecting resonance parameters and \\ncovariance in experimental nuclear data, fitting and analyzing incon -\\nsistent data, and correcting experimental uncertainties. Moreover, DL \\nmodels can also be used for verifying and benchmarking nuclear data. As \\nshown in other works with shallow models ( Neudecker et al., 2020 ), DL \\nmodels can be used to deepen the data verification and benchmarking \\nfrontier. Given sufficient experimental data, DL algorithms can also es -\\ntimate resonance parameters for heavy elements, and predict the level \\ndensities ( Dwivedi, 2019 ). DL algorithms can also be applied to optimize \\nreactor fuel assembly. As demonstrated by Radaideh et al. (2021b) , \\nDL-based optimization tools such as the NeuroEvolution Optimization \\nwith Reinforcement Learning (NEORL) can be used to optimize fuel cell \\ndesign and reactor control. The diverse algorithms in the NEORL tool are \\nalso important for broader performance evaluation of different algo -\\nrithms on a specific optimization task. Further, as demonstrated by \\nWhyte and Parks (2021) , DL models could be used to optimize the power \\npeaking factor (PPF) and to determine the position of the hottest pin at \\nthe beginning of the cycle (BOC) in a PWR core. DL algorithms can also \\nbe used for loading pattern optimization and other fuel management \\nissues. \\nTo enhance scalability, robustness and explainability in DL models \\nfor nuclear reactor safety, causality also needs to be considered. The \\nconventional DL approach learns the correlation in training data to \\nmake predictions. Moreover, traditional DL assumes independent and \\nidentically distributed input. However, the learned correlation may be \\nspurious or unstable, and the training data may be out of distribution. \\nHence, abstract representation (causal) learning is useful to properly \\nFig. 12.

Moreover, leveraging causality would \\naid the integration of reactor domain knowledge, which is critical for \\nbetter prediction. Besides, sampling bias problems can be reduced and \\nprediction reliability can be significantly improved, to obtain a robust \\npredictor that can generalize well in real-world analysis. Lastly, inte -\\ngrating unique features of causal models, such as latent structural \\nlearning and improved knowledge representation, into safety analysis of \\nnuclear reactors would present greater utility beyond the conventional \\nDL approach. \\n6. Conclusion \\nDL applications in complex systems have many advantages, which \\nprompt their rapid adoption in various fields. A DL algorithm eliminates \\nover-reliance on domain knowledge, does not require manual feature \\nextraction, offers an end-to-end learning process from raw data, and \\nautomatically learns hierarchical representations in large-scale data. It is \\nthus an innovative and robust tool for optimized safety analysis from \\nhigh volume and multi-dimensional nuclear reactor data. This has \\nprompted its adoption in both numerical and analytical reactor safety \\nresearch and development. However, obtaining dependable, realistic, \\nand reliable safety analysis results from DL models requires careful \\nattention to some issues. \\nThis paper presents the state-of-the-art deep-learning application in \\nthe nuclear reactor safety analysis and the critical issues and challenges \\nwith the model. This work also proposes robust solutions to the identi -\\nfied challenges, toward a safe and efficient reactor development and \\nsafety analysis. The reactor safety optimization with a DL-based surro -\\ngate model demonstrated in this work, and the explainability tools used \\nto interpret the model output are important contributions that support \\nan open, robust, and explainable DL application. The discussion in this \\nwork would also support the development of effective DL-based \\nmodeling tools and methods with a significant reduction in associated \\nuncertainties. The literature reviewed in this work, and the DL imple -\\nmentation framework provided would also guide researchers and engi -\\nneers in applying DL models for independent verification and \\ninterpretation of safety analysis results. Moreover, the open research \\nchallenges, opportunities, and future direction itemized would guide \\nadvanced research in DL applications for reactor safety. Considering the \\ncomplexity and safety requirements of nuclear reactors, regulatory \\napproval for safety analysis performed with innovative tools may be \\nproblematic. Implementing the recommendations in this work could \\nimprove the trustworthiness and explainability of DL-based safety \\nanalysis. \\nDeclaration of competing interest \\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial \\ninterests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence \\nthe work reported in this paper. \\nAcknowledgement \\nThe work of AA and HA are funded through the S ˆer Cymru II 80761- \\nBU-103 project by Welsh European Funding Office (WEFO) under the \\nEuropean Development Fund (ERDF).
